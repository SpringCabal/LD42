Skeleton Spring game.
Libraries are included as files (not git submodules) so just pull/push as usual.

To use this for a new game clone it in a separate repository. Do *not* add game-specific modifications. This should be generic and usable for future Spring games as well (think of it is "Z" in SpringABC).

This repository contains:
- SpringABC (using gajop's chili instead)
- analytics
- lups
- modelshaders
- S44 style OO defs
- and a bunch of other useful custom widgets and gadgets

Check out the wiki for detailed information.
